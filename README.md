## About The Project

This repository contains Java solutions to various LeetCode problems, designed to aid in preparation for coding interviews. Each solution includes detailed comments to explain the logic and approach, along with a `main` method for easy execution and output verification. The problems cover a range of data structures and algorithms, providing a comprehensive resource for practicing common interview questions.

### Key Features

- **Detailed Comments:** Each solution is thoroughly commented to explain the code's logic and reasoning.
- **Runnable Examples:** The inclusion of `main` methods allows for immediate execution and testing of the solutions.
- **Variety of Problems:** The repository covers a wide range of LeetCode problems, addressing different algorithmic concepts.
- **Clear and Concise Code:** The solutions are written in a clear and understandable style, making them easy to learn from.

## Architecture

The project is structured as a collection of individual Java files, each representing a solution to a specific LeetCode problem. The files are organized within a single directory, `tridibbanik17-javaforcodinginterview/`.

The technologies used in this project are:

*   **Java:** The primary programming language for implementing the solutions.
*   **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Core concepts used to solve the LeetCode problems.
*   **Scanner:** Used for reading user input in some of the solutions.
*   **StringBuilder:** Used for efficient string manipulation in some of the solutions.
*   **ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet:** Used for implementing solutions that require dynamic arrays, hash maps, and hash sets, respectively.
